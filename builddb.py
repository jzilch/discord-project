''' DOCUMENTATION

About:
	This script is fucking handy
	It handles a shitton of legwork required for developing a database
When to use it:
	- When you need to create the local database for the first time
	- When you update models.py
	- When you fuck up the data in the database
Usage:
	- change the ROOT_USER and CURRENT_USER variables below
	- delete the if ROOT_USER statement so the script doesn't exit
	- run $ ./builddb.py
Notes:
	- THIS SCRIPT DELETES ALL DATA MIGRATIONS
	- Make sure you know what a data migration is, and
	  that you know what discordapp/migrations/ is for
	  before running this
