This is the API for the SuperFam database.

About:
    - these API functions are to only be used by views.py.
    - these are the only functions allowed to access the database.

Summary:
    - get_member_by_username()
    - get_members()
    - get_pokemon_team_by_username()
    - get_social_media_by_username()
    - get_member_info()

TODO:
    Important:
        - Once we want to allow users to create accounts and comment around the website, we will need separate API functions for retrieving User objects.

    Optional:

Remember to cmd+f for TODO and NOTE.

def get_member_by_username(username):
    '''
    Purpose:
        Return a Member object based on a provided username.

    Params:
        - username (string): username of Member object to return.

    Return values:
        Intended:
            - Member object
        Erroneous:
            - ValueError: username parameter does not exist.
            - Other Error:
                - unexpected error occured querying the Member object.
    
    Function:
        Step 1.
            - query the database for a Member with the given username, returning None if the username is not found.
    
    TODO
        Optional:
            - make this function flexible by making username optional and adding more optional parameters. This should probably entail changing the function name; something like get_member_by_attribute().

    Purpose:
        Return a list of any number of Member objects sorted by member_id or by another column.

    Params:
        - sort_by (str): column by which to sort the Member list. Defaults to primary key "member_id".
        - amount (int): number of members to retrieve.

    Return values:
        Intended:
            - List[Member] object

    TODO
        Optional:
            - account for a change in the name of the member_id attribute of the Member class. Currently that column name is hardcoded. To account for a possible change, we must either throw an error or return a default value after determining that the query is failing on sorting by member_id.
